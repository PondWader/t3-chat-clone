# Syncing

The web app can live sync data (chat history/settings) between devices. Data is replicated to the browser locally, enabling a snappy experience with near instant response times to user actions.

Syncing can be setup by clicking "Login / Sync Devices" at the bottom of the sidebar and selecting "Continue with Discord" or "Sync devices without account" depending on your preference.

### Account Login

Signing in with Discord means you avoid the risk of accidentally losing your data if your browser clears site data. This is recommended.

### Accountless Syncing

It is possible to sync between devices simply by scanning a QR code/entering the link manually. This will replicate data between devices without the need to have a Discord account connected.
